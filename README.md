# P2P-communication-system-using-Blockchain

# This is a simple implementation of a blockchain network in Python. It consists of three main components:

- Blockchain: Defines the structure and functionalities of the blockchain. Blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, ensuring immutability and integrity of the data.
- Peer: Represents a node in the network. Peers can connect to each other, broadcast new blocks, and validate incoming blocks.
- Socket Communication: Peers communicate with each other using TCP/IP sockets. They can send and receive blocks to maintain a synchronized blockchain across the network.

# Key Features:

- Blockchain Creation: The blockchain is created with a genesis block to initiate the chain.
- Block Addition: New blocks are added to the chain with transactions and validated using cryptographic hashes.
- Peer-to-Peer Communication: Peers can connect to each other, exchange blocks, and maintain a consistent blockchain state.
- Blockchain Validation: The validity of the blockchain is ensured by checking the integrity of each block and its link with the previous block.

# How to Use:
- Clone the repository.
- Run 'python blockchain_network.py' to start the peers.
- Peers will automatically connect to each other and exchange blocks.
- Monitor the console output to see the communication between peers and blockchain validation.

# Dependencies:
- Python 3.x

# Future Improvements:
- Implement proof-of-work consensus mechanism for block validation.
- Add support for more complex transactions and smart contracts.
- Enhance security features to prevent tampering and attacks.
